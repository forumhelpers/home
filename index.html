This is a work-in-progress. Know that it will take about a week, maybe less, since this message is sent (6/22/2020) for the website to be complete.
This will be an improved version of <a target="_blank" href="https://theforumhelpers.github.io/">the original forum helpers website<a>.
Please be patient for the website to be completely remade, with better UI, and more helpful info!
It'll be constantly updated with helpful info!
In the mean time, be sure to check out the developer who's working on this website, <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ioton/">ioton</a> on Scratch!
Additional note: ioton is currently NOT part of the forum helpers.
